# Run21-Solver

Run21-Solver is a solver for the card game , Run21 .

In Run21 , there are 5 slots in which the user can place any number of cards into each slot . 
You are dealt a card with the goal to get each slot as close to or equal to 21 .
Aces originaly play as an 11 , but will be played as a 1 when needed .
Causing any column to reach over 21 results in a lose .

In this version , the agent just plays the game by itself .

Working on a version where the user and agent play the same card , so you can see
whether or not the agent did better than you .
